            <h1 class="center">About Us</h1>
            <p>Here at Bihome, it's our mission to serve the people and the environment. We want to provide the community with affordable homes, while keeping the enviornment safe. We plan to make homes that are self sustainable and enviornmentally friendly. We want our homes to be as self sustainable as possible, but remain affordable to the average person. Our homes would be built of recycled and sustainably sourced materials. We want to make these homes available to as many people as possible, and this is the challenge that sets us apart from other companies.</p>
